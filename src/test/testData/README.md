## Test Data

This is a simple parsing/lexing test case set.

We store input and expected output here, running test is to get the actual
output and do a comparison.

### Running tests

This script relies on relative path so please run it in the `src/test`
directory.

```shell
$ cd src/test
$ perl test_runner.pl
```

Feel free to submit PR to improve this -- I'm very unsatisfied with this way
of running test script.
