## Test Data

This is a simple parsing/lexing test case set.

We store input and expected output here,
running test is to get the actual output and do a comparison.

### Running tests

```shell
$ perl test_runner.pl
```

To run tests but do not ask for replacing golden values, run

```shell
$ perl test_runner.pl --no-terminal
```
